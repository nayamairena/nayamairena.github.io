#Final Project For Into to Web Dev
##Naya Mairena Flores

This project is a personal website that I built for this class.
The website showcases an introduction about myself, my previous experience, projects, and a contact form.
HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used for this program. Bootstrap and a JS Bootstrap plug in is utilized.

Websites that helped guide me:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.css
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/
https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-tabs.php

The website has been deployed using GitHub pages.
To test the website in VSCode, Live Server extension was used.
